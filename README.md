Edited the parameters.py file to add cheng-sher ansatz terms in off-diagonal elements of the Yukawa matrix. Aslo edited paramters.py file to add lepton mass, since the original version set lepton mass at zero. 
The original version of the UFO file can be found at " https://feynrules.irmp.ucl.ac.be/wiki/2HDM " by C.Dhur and M.Herquet.
